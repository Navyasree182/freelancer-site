Freelance Marketplace Platform
A full-stack freelance marketplace where clients post projects, freelancers bid on them, and accepted bids turn into contracts — built with Django REST (function-based views) + SQLite on the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Fetch API) on the frontend.

How to Run
1. Backend (Django REST API)
cd Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py makemigrations api
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
The API will be live at http://127.0.0.1:8000/. (Optional) create an admin user to browse data at /admin/:

python manage.py createsuperuser
2. Frontend
Just open Frontend/index.html directly in your browser (double-click it, or use VS Code's "Live Server" extension). It talks to the backend via fetch() calls to http://127.0.0.1:8000, so keep the Django server running while you use the site.

CORS is fully open (CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True) in core/settings.py specifically so the frontend can be opened from a different origin (file:// or a different port) during development/grading.

Login / Session Model
There's no separate auth table in the schema, so login is a lightweight, practical simulation: registering creates a Freelancer or Client record; logging in looks up that email in the corresponding table and stores the matched profile in localStorage as the active session. This is enough to drive role-based dashboards and to auto-attach freelancer_name / client_name on bids and projects, without inventing an extra module outside the given schema.

Core User Flow (matches Sample Testing Data in the brief)
A client registers → posts an "E-Commerce Website" project.
A freelancer registers → browses /projects.html → submits a bid.
The client opens /bids.html, sees the pending bid, clicks Accept.
Accepting a bid automatically:
creates a Contract (/contracts/add/)
flips the project's status to In Progress
Both dashboards (/dashboard.html) reflect the new contract, and it can be marked Completed or Cancelled from /contracts.html.
Postman Testing
Import the endpoints above into Postman (or use the curl examples in this README) to generate the required API testing screenshots — every endpoint was manually verified with curl during development (create, list, update, filter/search, and delete all confirmed working end-to-end).

Notes for Submission
Take a screenshot of db.sqlite3 contents via python manage.py shell or the Django admin (/admin/) for the "Database Screenshot" requirement.
Take Postman screenshots for each of the 20+ endpoints.
Take frontend screenshots of each page (Home, Register, Login, Projects, Bids, Contracts, Dashboard).
